# different ways of formating strings
names="ken"
title="mr president"
print(f"his title is {title} {names}") #prints out his title is mr president ken
#this can also be done similarly
print ("his title is " ""  + title + " " + names)#prints out his title is mr president ken

# getting different lengths of strings
#we use len function
#example
country= "Uganda" 
Continent="africa"
print (len(country)) #prints out 6
print(len(Continent))# also prints 6 as the total number of letters
